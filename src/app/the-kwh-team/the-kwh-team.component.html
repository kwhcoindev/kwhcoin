					<h5>Development and Design</h5>
					<p>
						Eric Rynne, the owner of ER Productions, a web design company, graduated from Masters Institute in 1999 with a degree in Multimedia and Science of Design.
					</p>
					<p>
						He worked at different companies heavily involved in the design process. Being involved in startups forced him to understand the art of design and proper web development. From 2001 to 2011, Eric did web development projects on the side while working full time at other companies. During the startup phase, he created landing pages and full ecommerce sites for small and medium local businesses in his home town of San Jose, CA. The side business, ER Productions, kept growing and growing, which eventually turned into his full time in October of 2011. Eric has never looked back!Last year Girard Newkirk reached out to ER Productions to develop a logo. Based off Eric’s energy and his exemplary reviews, we knew he was the right fit to create the proper vision and brand for our revolutionary token. Once we synergies developed we turned to the wonderful team to build our website. We were in the need of a quick turn around and he delivered a complete site within 4 days. KWHCoin was amazed with ER Productions ability to deliver quality for a timely turnaround and couldn’t be happier with the outcome.

						Eric told us… <i>“I am so excited to be a part of something so big. I recognize the world is changing and changing at a rapid pace. I know renewable energy is the future and KWHCoin is the perfect platform to incentivize more buyers to get involved. The future is bright and so is KWHCoin. Cheers to the next chapter.”</i> We are grateful to have Eric on the KWHCoin team.
