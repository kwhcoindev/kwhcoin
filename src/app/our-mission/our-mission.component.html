					<h4>KWHCoin is a digital currency...</h4>
					<p>that converts renewable distributed energy resources to digital tokens on a unique blockchain. The energy generation used to back KWH tokens are generated from numerous renewable energy sources including solar power generators, solar communities, microgrids, electric vehicles, energy storages, wind energy, and hydroelectric power generators. All energy that is converted to KWH tokens is generated through 100% clean renewable energy.</p>

			    <h2>Our Goal and Vision</h2>
					<p>KWHCoin is building an application that will provide network participants with a platform to trade, exchange, donate and democratize the value of two-way generation on power grids worldwide.</p>
					<p>Our decentralized virtual global power company will be peer to peer and will use the internet as a digital rail to deliver clean localized energy to all members of the network, without the need of a trusted third party or centralized power. We will not use any forms of energy that primarily come from fossil fuel production in our conversion process.</p>
					<p>Our team will leverage blockchain technology and smart contracts to build a decentralized network of distributed clean energy resources. The Grid network will use software and cooperation between peers to provide a global virtual power company. The execution of power generation and the distribution delivery of clean electricity will be fully decentralized. Once complete, our borderless, peer-to-peer virtual power grid will operate seamlessly, with no obstructions, and with a zero carbon footprint.</p>
					<p>Our mission is to lead the change in supplying humanity with clean energy. With support from clean energy advocates, nations, companies and charitable organizations we plan to provide a viable solution for the 1.2 billion people who currently lack access to energy. The Grid will provide 100% clean, renewable energy, direct from solar and distributed energy resources, that access all renewable elements.</p>
					<p>KWHCoin and The Grid will provide an alternative marketplace for the exchange of clean energy; providing a model for a decentralized, network owned energy company of the future. In Africa and southeast Asia there are currently almost 2 billion people living without daily access to electricity, but with Our investment microgram development and the ICO donation structure, we aim to provide people with an opportunity for change.</p>
					<p>Our renewable energy platform will be deployed this year, encouraging sustainability and the emergence of a distributed clean power grid on a global scale.</p>
